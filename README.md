# Josh Mayer's Social Media DALI Chanllenge

Demo [here](https://dalisocialmedia.vercel.app).

### Idea of the project:
This website is meant to be a message board or feedback portal for the members of the DALI Lab. 

### Feature 1: Search Bar
The first feature I implemented is the search bar. This simply just looks through the names of all the members, and allows the user to easily navigate to the person they are looking for.

### Feature 2: Adding Comments
My next feature is the skeleton of a comment system under each individual team member. This would allow users to give feedback and ask questions to any DALI member. Since this was only a frontend project, it seemed beyond the scope to save the comments added, and store them for each member. Instead, the website just mimicks the UX behind this feature.
